# What  I'm 'planting' about  🌱 

### **1. Building products**

**experiences, questions, or thoughts related to products**
*I work as a Product professional, and that's something I'm passionate about, so one of the things I'll be working on is definitely some* 

### **2. Personal knowledge management, and tools for thought**

**tools for thought, personal knowlegde management, (collaborative) note-making, building a second brain, and how it all fits with knowledge work**
*I'm curious about PKM and note-making. It's a bit 'meta', but this garden will contain a lot of stuff on gardening.*

### **3. Books, reading and learning**

**thoughts on different books, book reviews and recommendations**

### **4. Random sparks of curiosity**

**musings on [[garden by Milos/Currently growing/🪴 random things that interest me 🪴\|🪴 random things that interest me 🪴]] at a given time**

#### 👨🏻‍🌾 What's a digital garden? ✂️🌳​

*Contextually speaking, it's an online space to share, nurture and shape ideas.* 

*Practically speaking, it's something between private notes and blog, used for learning and building in public.*

*This is where I learn in public, plant ideas, and see them grow into something exciting.*
