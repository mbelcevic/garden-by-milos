```python

while(you are gone): True
	days are different
	& I mentally collect small items
	
	for each_moment_I_think_of_you in day:
		add item to Collection

	# Collection grows
	
	Collection{
		"mug" : "you made me coffee",
		"your chair" : "emptiness",
		"my crutches" : "slow recovery and vulnerability of needing help",
		"iPhone charger" : "will you have time to shoot me a message",
		"dog" : "he misses you as well",
		"messy desk" : "not good it will annoy you",
		"again crutches" : "hope it gets better soon and we travel somewhere",
		"sneakers" : "you have so many nice sneakers"
		"dog again" : ...
	}
	
	# Items are ordinary
	# Thoughts are ordinary
	# But I feel soft depressive undertone
	# and anxiety as I don't need one more depression

when(you come home): True
	everything is happier
	& I forget the collection
	& depression seems to be 
		just a distant thought
			just for now
	 
```
