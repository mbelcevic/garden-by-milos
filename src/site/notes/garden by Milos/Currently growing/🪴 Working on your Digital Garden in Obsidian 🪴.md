*I have experience with different tools for note-making: Roam Research, Notion, Obsidian or Evernote way before. I switched to Obsidian in ~September 2022, and since recently, I set up this digital garden using Obsidian + [obidian-digital-garden plugin](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden) by [@okeeskild](https://ole.dev/)*

*Maybe I should share some experiences around organizing the notes, personal tweaks etc.*
