#### 👨🏻‍🌾 What's a digital garden? ✂️🌳​

*Contextually speaking, it's an online space to share, nurture and shape ideas.* 

*Practically speaking, it's something between private notes and blog, used for learning and building in public.*

*This is where I learn in public, plant ideas, and see them grow into something exciting.*
