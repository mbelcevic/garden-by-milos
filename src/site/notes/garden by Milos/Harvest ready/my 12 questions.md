### 01: How to live a happy life
- What does a happiness mean to me?
- How can I make sure I live a happy life?
- Does a good life always is a happy life, or can you have a good but not happy life (and vice versa)?

### 02: What does it mean to work
- What are the different qualities of different types of working?
- How has work changed since hunter/gatherers to today, and how it will change with new technologies?
- How can I work better?
- Can you create value without work? And when you create value, how do you amplify it?
- Is work my identity although I keep saying to myself: you are not your job.
- (But if work is more than a job (and I believe it is), could work be our life, our life's meaning, or at least a crucial piece in the way we live it?)

### 03: How is innovation and wealth created
-   From personal wealth to the wealth of nations, how is wealth created?
-   How do I create wealth for myself and my family, in a win-win, 'positive-sum game' where it's not at someone's expense. On contrary, how do I create wealth for myself and my family, while lifting others up?
-   What is the interaction between the wealth and innovation? And how do we keep a balance between a generous distribution of wealth to benefit as many people as possible, versus hampering innovation?
-   Is there a 'positive-sum game' to implement so the wealth creation benefits as many people as possible?
-   If there are such approaches / 'positive-sum games' why are we not playing them? What needs to be true for everyone to start playing them?

### 04: What is identity
-   Ranging from a philosophical and ethical aspect ‚Äì to practical and technological: what is identity?
-   How do we preserve and protect, yet expose and interact?
-   Digital Identity with its perks and pitfalls.
-   Is identity a human quality? Do animals have identity? Machines? And does it have to be individual ‚Äì is there a group identity? How does a group identity reflect on individual identity (national, class, gender, clubs and organizations, companies...?)

### 05: Future-proofing myself
-   What skills, insights and experiences will make one future-proof? How to acquire them?
-   How to make sure my health is best possible and my body serves me well long-term?
-   What other elements of and for my life are crucial? Friendships, family, support network... geopolitical?
-   If I ever crack the (small part) of the code ‚Äì how can I share it, spread it, and amplify so that more people can benefit.
-   How to strike a fine balance between living and enjoying the moment, and working for the future?

### 06: Why do we keep on going
-   What force within us keeps us alive, wanting to keep going and moving forward? Not biologically, not spiritually, not anything defined... just this "life (energy) inside" that keeps us going. How can I put my finger on it and define it?
-   How does that "life (energy) inside" relate to our Identity?
-   How can I make sure I _want_ to keep going, and how/why I manage to keep going in the times I didn't want to.
-   What happens if someone either looses the "life inside" or makes a calculation that it is obsolete to keep going? Can this be a rational, appropriate choice? Should it be discouraged? Banned?

### 07: How to live true to myself
-   Being unapologetically yourself sounds awesome ‚Äì but what if it doesn't work like that?
-   How to strike a proper balance?

### 08: How to live a balanced life
-   How can I balance learning, creating, professional work, resting, family and friends?
-   If you want to shoot for the stars, is it at all possible to have a balanced life? But also what kind of life do I want, in the end, and do I care for the stars?
-   By very nature, I'm not a balanced person. Should I strive to become one? Do I want to? If yes, how?

### 09: What is most important in life
-   What are the single most important aspects of our life?
-   Do we treasure them enough? or forget them for daily items and 'standard life stuff'?
-   Is there something universally most important, or each needs to find their own?

### 10: What does it mean to be kind
-   What does it mean to be kind?
-   How can I be living true to myself ‚Äì without being unkind toward others?

### 11: Managing (personal) Knowledge and Beyond
-   How best to build my own Personal Knowledge Management system?
-   What is the role of Tools for Thought
-   How do we manage group knowledge and foster innovation within and across organization, or even wider ‚Äì nations and global society
-   If working means to live, and my work is knowledge-work, so learning; does managing my knowledge equal managing my life?
-   Am I personal kanban with note-making system in a meaningful way?
