## 🌳 Garden(ing)

I plant seeds (open topics) on the go, for the things I would like to explore publically and work on in here.

It's usually a bit less messy than my private note-making, and also more focused / less noisy.

Digital garden(ing) and private note-making influence each other a lot; and likely lead to additional stuff that's more polished, such as articles, blog posts and other content.

Learn here about my private [[garden by Milos/Currently growing/🪴 note-making and second brain 🪴\|🪴 note-making and second brain 🪴]] process.

## ...and tools  ⛏️

**For my Digital Garden** I use:

[Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) with [obsidian-digital-garden](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden) plugin by [ole.dev](https://ole.dev/).

For my private note-making I use:

[Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) with 2 vaults: 1 for private + freelance projects; 1 for my full-time job.

[Apple notes](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205773) for quick capture on the go; which I then refine and put into one of the vaults as appropriate

[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15483285.Milo_Bel_evi_) to keep track over the books I have read, and want to read
